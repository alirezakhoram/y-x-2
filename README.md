# step 0 How does the code work?
This updated code trains the model on a dataset of 1000 input-output pairs, generated using torch.randn. It then evaluates the model on a separate validation set of 100 input-output pairs, and prints the mean validation loss.

The updated code also includes error handling for user input, so that the program won't crash if the user enters a non-numeric value. Finally, it includes a while loop that allows the user to input multiple values to calculate the square power of, until they enter 'q' to quit.
# step 1 y-x-2 with NN
Calculation of the second power of a number with the help of neural networks
# step 2 How do I run the file?
If you have your own dataset, you can train the neural network model with your own data.
# step 3 Open the file and run it.
file y =x-2   
Train on more data: Your model is only trained on a single input value generated randomly. Consider using a larger dataset with a variety of input values to train your model and improve its accuracy
