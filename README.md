# step 1 y-x-2 with NN
Calculation of the second power of a number with the help of neural networks
# step 2 How do I run the file?
If you have your own dataset, you can train the neural network model with your own data.
# step 3 Open the file and run it.
file y =x-2   
Train on more data: Your model is only trained on a single input value generated randomly. Consider using a larger dataset with a variety of input values to train your model and improve its accuracy.
